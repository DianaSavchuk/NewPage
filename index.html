      <p> Hello! My name is Diana, I am 22 years old, I am from the small town called Netishyn in Ukraine. I moved to Britain at the beginning of March due to the terrible events that happened in my country.
        I really like to travel, meet new people and just enjoy my life. I like to cook delicious dishes, especially dishes from Ukrainian cuisine, as well as desserts.
        I like to do sports, cycling and yoga, I also like to read books and watch sunsets.
        Before moving here, I worked as a deputy director at Global Restaurant Group. I liked my work, but I always gravitated towards technical skills.
        In 2021, I received a bachelor's degree in Automation and Instrumentation, now I am studying remotely to obtain a master's degree in the same specialty.
        I decided to try the CodeYourFuture course because I think it's a great opportunity to take a step into the tech industry.</p>
